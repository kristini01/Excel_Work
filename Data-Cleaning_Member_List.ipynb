I then **adjust the column widths** to have a better look at the data.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111613599/199521530-88b82f13-da97-4ca5-920b-83d02c8d59d6.png)\n\n##Next, I begin by checking the columns for errors. Upon examining the id column, it appears that there should be a 4 digit id number. I go through and look to make sure this is consistent. By **using the LEN function** and looking at the **filter** options, I find out that one of the id #'s is 3 digits instead of 4. This would be when I would investigate this instance before making any changes. For purposes of this activity, I simply added a zero to the end.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111613599/199527277-abd74cb8-ffdb-4bfc-84b9-39cc02a535b5.png)\n\n##The next column was names and I wanted to check for *duplicates*. I did this by using the **Remove Duplicates** function and there were in fact a few duplicate entries.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111613599/199527301-8fee9681-bc4d-4d88-a62c-9d18c3142a44.png)\n\n##To check the state, zipcode and country columns, I repeat the **LEN** process. When checking the state colums, I find 2 entries that have 3 characters instead of 2. I **filter** to fix these and notice that they appear normal. This is likely a case of extra spaces. I use the **TRIM** function to try and remove the spaces and the state column is now correct. \n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111613599/199527340-63e604f1-8423-4285-a34d-5c14223179fd.png)\n\n##Moving on to the zipcode column, using the **LEN** function again, I see that some of the zipcodes are not 5 digits. This is easily remedied by looking up those with missing numbers, by the city. Turns out, these had leading zeros that were being removed by the format of the cells. After changing the\nformat to text and replacing the zeros, this was fixed.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111613599/199527395-a0429f02-d9f0-4f51-92df-a87c13c4ff14.png)\n\n##I repeated the process on the country column and realized that there were a few entries that had 3 character country abbreviations instead of 2. I used the **Find and Replace** function to replace \"USA\" with \"US.\"\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111613599/199527440-bffe40de-fc28-4804-8a44-4c7715f825ee.png)\n\n##Althought this excel file was small, it's important to note that I would also use **conditional formatting** to highlight cells with blanks. This would allow me to either remove the row or find the missing information, if necessary.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111613599/199527494-3823877e-0675-4e6b-a7c0-19a67789710c.png)\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
